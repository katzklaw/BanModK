### INFORMATION

BanMod was created mainly because AmongUs has become a place full of rude players

and/or players who team up ruining the gaming experience.

Unfortunately the simple ban of Among

is circumvented by changing the ip of the device or using a vpn!!!

### Features

> - You can enable chat to access the banmenu and kick troll or afk players without having to wait for the next meeting
> - Immediately deny access to lobbies to players with names you have banned (Denyname.txt)
> - Immediately deny access to lobbies to players who are on the list (banList.txt) or to players who are on the blocked list on Among.
> - Kick or ban those who use banned words or who spam start, you can set from 0 to 5 allowed words before kicking.
> - You have a countdown in the lobby to see how much time is left until the game closes automatically (may not be real, for example if you become host after the previous host has left)
> - You can prevent the game from starting if you accidentally pressed the Start button.
> - You can enable or disable zoom (only works in the lobby or if you died, to avoid cheating)
> - You can enable or disable lobby decorations, you must exit and recreate the lobby to activate the changes
> - You can disable or enable lobby music
> - You can kick your friends out of the kick for spamming and swearing (FriendsList.txt)

To install the mod, just copy the contents into the main folder of among.
(There are several tutorials online, if you encounter problems do not hesitate to contact me.)

The mod will create a new folder called BAN_DATA,

from there you can add names and banned words and add/remove players from the ban list.
